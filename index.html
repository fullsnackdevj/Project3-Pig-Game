      <ul class="game-mechanics-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Objective:</strong> The first player to reach a total score of
          <strong>50</strong> wins the game.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Players:</strong> There are two players who take turns rolling
          a dice and accumulating points.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rolling the Dice:</strong> Each player rolls a dice, and the
          number they roll is added to their <strong>current score</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Holding the Score:</strong> Players can
          <strong>hold</strong> their current score at any time during their
          turn by pressing the "Hold" button. The current score is added to
          their <strong>total score</strong>, and the turn switches to the next
          player.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rolling a 1:</strong> If a player rolls a <strong>1</strong>,
          and they havenâ€™t held their current score, their
          <strong>current score resets to 0</strong>, and they lose all the
          points accumulated during that turn.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Switching Turns:</strong> After pressing the
          <strong>Hold</strong> button or rolling a <strong>1</strong>, the turn
          passes to the next player.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="strategy-tip">
        <p>
          <strong>Strategy Tip:</strong> Be strategic! Hold your score before
          taking too many risks. If you roll a <strong>1</strong> without
          holding, your turn's progress resets to zero!
        </p>

        <h3>Game Flow:</h3>

            Player 1 rolls the dice, and the number is added to their current
            score.
          </li>
          <li>Player 1 decides to either roll again or hold their score.</li>
          <li>
            If Player 1 holds, the current score is added to the total, and it
            switches to Player 2.
          </li>
          <li>
            If Player 1 rolls a 1, their current score resets to 0, and Player 2
            takes over.
